# Code of Conduct

## Quick Version

The heart of our meetup is people. We gain strength through diversity, experience through variation, and actively seek participation from anyone willing to positively contribute.

We are committed to creating a productive, open, and safe community that welcomes new ideas and inspiration for all attendees regardless of gender, sexual orientation, age, ability, ethnicity, political views, socioeconomic status, and religion.

This Code of Conduct outlines our expectations for all meetup participants, as well as the consequences for unacceptable behavior.

## Long Version

### Encouraging & Recognizing Participation

We seek to increase meaningful collaboration by encouraging everyone to participate in presentations and discussions regardless of experience.

Intentional, positive action is essential to avoid replicating the many forms of inequality that exist in our society.

If you see someone who is making an extra effort to ensure our event is welcoming, friendly, and encourages participants to contribute, recognize them for their good work either personally or by letting organizers know.

### Expected Behavior

**The following behaviors are expected of all participants to our meetups, including attendees, speakers, and organizers.**

#### Be Respectful

Disagreement is no excuse for poor manners. We might all experience some frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into personal attacks. It’s important to remember that a community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one. Collaboration before conflict, always.

#### Watch Your Language

We are a community of professionals, and we should conduct ourselves professionally. Refrain from discriminatory, demeaning, or harassing speech. This includes gestures and online discussions/back-channels including, but not limited to: meetup pages, facebook, slack, telegram, or other social media platforms.

#### Agree To Disagree

It is important we resolve disagreements and differing views, both social and technical, constructively. Different people have different perspectives on issues. Being unable to understand why someone holds a viewpoint doesn’t mean that they’re wrong. Focus on helping to resolve issues and learning from mistakes.

#### Look Out For Each Other

Be mindful of your surroundings and your fellow participants. Alert an event organizer if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or any violations of this Code of Conduct. If something or someone makes you feel concerned, even if you're unsure it's a violation, it's better to reach out, than to ignore it.

### Unacceptable Behavior

**The following behaviors are considered harassment and are UNACCEPTABLE:**

#### Violence

Inciting violence and/or threat of violence towards any individual, including encouraging a person to commit self-harm. This includes posting or threatening to post other people's personally identifying information ("doxing").

#### Derogatory Language

Hurtful or harmful language related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, mental illness, appearance, race, religion, age, or socioeconomic status. If you're unsure if a word is derogatory, don't use it.

#### Sexual Behavior

Unwelcome sexual attention. This includes, sharing or distributing sexualized images, unwelcome sexualized comments or jokes, inappropriate touching, groping, and unwelcome sexual advances.

#### Disruptive Behavior

Sustained disruption of our events. This includes talking over speakers or influencing crowd actions that are contrary to the direction of the session.

#### Instigating

Influencing the over-consumption of alcohol and encouraging any of the above behavior. Advocating for or encouraging any of the above behavior is the same as committing that behavior yourself, and therefore the same consequences apply.

### Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior

Unacceptable behavior from any participant, including attendees, speakers, and organizers, will NOT be tolerated.

Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately or leave.

If an event participant engages in unacceptable behavior, the organizers may take any action they deem appropriate. Including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from all future events.

### Reporting Guidelines

If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please notify the organizers team as soon as possible.

Additionally, event organizers are available to help meetup members help those experiencing unacceptable behavior feel safe. In the context of in-person events, organizers will also provide support with contacting local law enforcement if necessary.

#### Addressing Grievances

If you feel you have been falsely or unfairly accused of violating this Code of Conduct, you should notify the [organizers](#contact-info) with a concise description of your grievance.

#### Scope

All meetup participants, attendees, speakers, and organizers, are expected to abide by this Code of Conduct in all meetup venues — online and in-person.

This Code of Conduct and its related procedures also applies to unacceptable behavior occurring outside the scope of meetup activities when such behavior has the potential to adversely affect the safety and well-being of our meetup members.
